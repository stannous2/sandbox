On your own...
Using Bootstrap components and some of your own CSS / jQuery...
Create a page from scratch with the following properties + content
- Max-width of 1200px
- Centered when the content is greater than 1200px
- Aside from the hero, each section should have generous top/bottom margins (let your content breathe!)
- Your text color should stand out from whatever background color it's on top of
Create a hero section
- This section needs to expand to the edges of the window, even when wider than 1200px
- Find a cool, large background image - at least 1400px wide
- It should be a max-height of 400px
- Center a title, subheader, and a CTA button on their own lines using flexbox
- Make sure the text is a color that stands out from the image
- Add a “text-shadow” CSS property to the text so it stands out even more
- Clicking the CTA button should scroll you to the accordion section
Create a section with a 3 column row on white background
- Each column should have an image, but make the images circles using only CSS (HINT: Google it)
- When you hover over the image, make it darker
--- BONUS: Can you animate the opacity change?
--- HINT: You will need an empty div positioned over your image..they will both require a parent div
- Each image should be centered vertically and horizontally in its space
Create a section with expansion/collapse panels (sometimes called accordions)
- There should be 3 panels across a row (Bootstrap calls them "Collapse" on their components list)
- Clicking the header for one expands it to show some detail text
- This section should have a centered header above the accordions and a background color
- On mobile, the 3 panels should stack
Create a footer section
- This should have a different background color as well
- 4 column layout, with a list of links in each column
- The list items should NOT have bullet points
- When you hover over a link, do a CSS transition to transition the color property
- On mobile, each column should stack
Create a fixed-position "back to top" button
- The button should be affixed to the bottom left of the screen
- Clicking the button should scroll you back to the top of the document
